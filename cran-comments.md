This is a resubmission of a new release. 
From my perspective, there are no references that I need to cite in the package. However, I found the original paper by Georgy Voronoi, who introduced the geometrical structure now known as Voronoi diagrams. As a tribute to his work, Iâ€™ve included the reference in the package and function descriptions.
